# Mini Chat CRUD App

This is a simple chat application built using:

- Express.js for the backend
- EJS for templating
- MongoDB + Mongoose for database operations

###  Features

-  Create new chat messages
-  Edit existing messages
-  Delete chats
-  View all messages

This project was created as a practice to learn full-stack development using the MERN-like stack (without React). Great for understanding server-side rendering and CRUD flow.
